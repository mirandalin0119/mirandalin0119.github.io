	<h2>Dell's Product Webpage Redesign</h2>


<div id = "details">
	<div id = "col-sm-12">
		<h4> Redesign Process </h4>
		<p>
			When I visited Dell's XPS 13 laptop's webpage, the first thing I noticed was that the page was
			very lengthy and presented a lot of information at once. Thus, my main goal in the redesign
			was to make the webpage simpler so that it serves as an introductory page to attract
			users to the XPS 13 model in general, and not a page that overwhelms users with various
			configuration details at once.
      </br></br><b>Note:</b> This is purely a personal project, and not affiliated with Dell. Photos and
			information regarding the XPS 13 in courtesy of their official XPS 13 page, which can be accessed
			<a href= "http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9360-laptop"> here. </a>


			</br></br>

			<b> Navigation Bar: </b> Because my intention wasn't to redesign Dell's whole site, I kept their blue
			navigation bar the same to provide consistency between their different pages.
			</br></br>
		 	<b> Introduction: </b> In the brief introduction to the XPS 13 right after the navigation bar,
			the original page has a few lines of text on the left, and a picture/video of the laptop on the right.
			Though simple already, I decided to make this introductory section more visual by placing an image carousel
			in the center of the page with the text "XPS 13" on top.
			</br></br>
			<center><img src = "pictures/dellredesign1.png" style="width:auto;height:300px;margin-top:2%;display:inline-block;"></center>
		</p>


		<p>
			</br></br>
			<b> Features: </b> Right after the image carousel, I listed out four features of the XPS 13. Each feature
			is represented with an icon and a brief text. Below the four features, I have a "See All Features" button
			that would take the user to another page (or an overlay) where they'd be able to obtain more details.
			This is one of the biggest difference between my design and the original, where in the original,
			there is a designated "Features" section. Though informational, I believe that the original "Features"
			section contains more details than necessary on a main XPS 13 page, making the overall page too overwhelming.
			The left side of the image below is only <i> one </i> part of a lengthier "Features" section on Dell's page.
			</br></br>
			<center><img src = "pictures/dellredesign2.png" style="width:auto;height:320px;margin-top:2%;display:inline-block;"></center>
		</p>


		<p>
			</br></br>
			<b> Configurations: </b> Dell has 4 different filters located at the top of this section, including the laptop's
			hard drive, memory, operating system, and processor. In my design, I moved these filters to the left hand side
			instead. Additionally, instead of a dropdown menu, I changed the filter options to radio buttons. I believe
			that because there isn't a lot of options for each filter, radio buttons simplify the filtering process. I also
			decided to take out the Operating System filter, because there is only one option present (Windows 10).
			</br></br>
			<center><img src = "pictures/dellredesign3.png" style="width:auto;height:340px;margin-top:2%;display:inline-block;"></center>
		</p>


		<p>
			</br></br>
		 	I also simplified the configuration information displayed. In their design, Dell first includes summarized
			information regarding each configuration, with green "View Details" buttons at the end. Then, very detailed
			configuration information is listed, followed by another set of the green "View Details" buttons. Some of the
			information listed here is redundant; some details included here have already been included in the summarized
			section above. Though the design makes it easy for users to compare the different configurations at a detailed
			level, it also makes the webpage very clustered. Not to mention that Dell already has a
			comparison tool, as displayed by the "Add to compare" selection boxes next to each configuration,
			that can help users make comparisons.
			</br></br>
			In my redesign, I simplified this section by including only 4 pieces of information for each configuration.
			These are the same information that Dell listed in its summarized section. Following this, I also have
			"View Details" buttons, but I changed the color to blue to match the overall color scheme. To compare
			different configurations in detail, I kept Dell's comparison tool, but moved the "Add to Compare" selection
			boxes to below the "View Details" buttons. When users choose to compare the different configurations, then
			they will be displayed additional details like what Dell currently has. Otherwise, I eliminated the whole
			detailed configurations section from the web page.
			</br></br>
			<center><img src = "pictures/dellredesign4.png" style="width:auto;height:340px;margin-top:2%;display:inline-block;"></center>
		</p>


		<p>
			</br></br>
			<b> Accessories: </b> Dell split its accessories for XPS 13 into two sections, one being mobile essentials,
			and the other being work essentials. Each accessory has a picture along with a brief description. I decided
			to simplify this section by combining the two sections into just one "Essential Accessories" section. In
			this section, I display the accessories in two rows, and eliminated the descriptions for each accessory, keeping
			only the picture. To obtain more information regarding each section, the user can click on the accessory.
			</br></br>
			<center><img src = "pictures/dellredesign5.png" style="width:auto;height:400px;margin-top:2%;display:inline-block;"></center>
		</p>


		<p>
			</br></br>
			<b> Support, Awards: </b> In my redesign, I kept Dell's support section that provides brief descriptions of
			the three different support services. However, I decided to eliminate the Awards section.
			</br></br>
			<center><img src = "pictures/dellredesign6.png" style="width:auto;height:300px;margin-top:2%;display:inline-block;"></center>
		</p>


		<p>
			</br></br>
			<b> Reviews: </b> Dell presents this section with bar graph visualizations that provides an overall rating
			snapshot, followed by specific feedback from users. I simplified this section by keeping only the bar graph
			visualizations, and eliminated the individual feedbacks from the page. However, users can still see these
			individual reviews by clicking the "See all Reviews" button located at the bottom right corner of the section.
			</br></br>
			<center><img src = "pictures/dellredesign7.png" style="width:auto;height:300px;margin-top:2%;display:inline-block;"></center>
		</p>


		<p>
			</br></br>
			<b> Questions, Drivers, Manuals & Support, Suggested Products: </b> I decided to eliminate all 3 of these sections
			from the main page. I believe that these are important information that users may need, however, I believe that
			they don't all need to be displayed on the main XPS 13 page. Perhaps there can be links that direct users to
			these sections, but having such an abundance of information on the page makes the webpage very overwhelming.
