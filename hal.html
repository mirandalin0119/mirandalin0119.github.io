					<h4> Context</h4>
					<p> Under Carnival Corporation is Holland America Group, which includes 4 cruise brands: Holland
						America Line, Seabourn,
						Princess Cruises, and P&O Australia. Inside the Holland America Group office in Seattle is a
						large wall display that
						maps the live location of each cruise in the four brands. This digital product is called
						<i>Insight</i>. Insight automatically rotates through each cruise, displaying information on
						ship time, latitude and longitude,
						speed, temperature, wind speed, webcam picture, departure and destination ports, and social
						media updates. Though Insight
						provides a great overview to all the cruises, this information is not accessible to guests
						onboard the cruise itself.
						Thus, the vision for this project was to develop a version of Insight that would be incorporated
						into Holland America
						Line's Navigator and Seabourn's Source web and mobile app for guests to interact with while
						onboard their cruise. The
						following describes the problem statement of the project:
					</p>
					<b>Given that Holland America Group's existing digital fleet map is scaled for large landscape
						displays, how do we translate
						it to mobile, tablet, and laptop views for 850,000+ users to easily interact with?</b>

					</br>
					</br>

					<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
					<p>
						To understand what various related products exist on the market today, I did some searching and
						found
						<a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/">MarineTraffic</a>
						and
						<a href="https://www.vesselfinder.com/">VesselFinder</a>, both of which are web resources that
						maps live location and list details on vessels around the world.
						In exploring these products and their features, I was able to determine the scope of this
						project, including what features
						to include and not include in the design. Research also helped me consider how to present
						information of the cruises
						without overwhelming users and how to design user interactions to ensure for ease of use.
					</p>
					</br>
					</br>

					<h4>Goals</h4>
					<p>After research and defining the scope, the following goals were developed with the stakeholders:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Ability for guests to locate all cruises in the same brand</li>
						<li>Ability to learn facts about different ships and ports </li>
						<li>Maintain existing design style defined by the brand </li>
						<li>Ensure for consistency, usability, and an exceptional UX</li>
					</ul>
					</br>
					</br>

							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>

					</br>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Home Screen/Live Map:</b> Located at the top is local navigation bar with two views-- 1)
							View of all cruises on a
							map and 2) View of all cruises in a list. On the left hand side is a minimized panel with
							numbers corresponding to
							each day of the guest's itinerary. The main section consists of a world map with cruise
							icons (dots) throughout, each
							representing the location of cruises from the same brand. The cruise the guest is on will
							have a different icon for
							the guest to easily locate their cruise, and their cruise path is displayed by default. The
							path already traveled
							will be presented in a solid line and the path not traveled presented in a dotted line. Upon
							tapping another dot (another
							cruise), the user will get to see that cruise's path. The plus and minus icons in the lower
							right hand corner provide
							another option to zoom in and out of the map in addition to the zooming in and out gesture
							common across touchscreen
							devices. Located at the bottom is a panel with four icons representing four different
							statistics deemed as the most
							important information users would want to know about a cruise. For instance, this could
							include ship time, speed,
							temperature, and wind speed. This bottom panel will only be displayed when a cruise is
							selected. Otherwise, the map
							will span across the whole screen.
						</li>
						</br>
						<li>
							<b>Itinerary Side Panel:</b> Upon tapping on or swipping right from the minimized side panel
							on the home screen, it expands
							to cover approximately 3/4 of the screen. The guest will be able to find information on a
							cruise's itinerary in this
							panel, with each number corresponding to the day of the itinerary. A solid line connecting
							between the days indicates
							that day/itinerary has been complete, and a dotted line indicates that day/itinerary has not
							occurred yet. This corresponds
							to the style of the line as displayed on the map view in the home screen. Next to each
							number is a block of text with
							a bold header detailing the location of the cruise and a brief paragraph detailing
							information about that location.
							To navigate back to the homes screen, the user can tap on the right 1/4 portion of the
							screen that's not covered by
							the panel.
						</li>
						</br>
						<li>
							<b>Cruise Statistics:</b> On the home screen, when the user taps on a cruise, the bottom
							panel will be displayed with
							four icons and text for statistics about the cruise, such as wind speed. Upon tapping or
							swiping up from the panel,
							the display will be expanded to cover the lower 3/4 of the user's screen. The icons and
							their stats regarding the
							cruise will remain at the top, followed by other less important statistics guests may want
							to know about a ship. Finally,
							at the bottom of the panel will be two live webcam view of the cruise. To navigate back to
							the home screen, the user
							can tap on the upper 1/4 portion of the screen that's not covered by the panel.
						</li>
						</br>
						<li>
							<b>List View of All Cruises:</b> To navigate into the list view of all cruises, the guest
							can tap on the "Vessels" button
							located in the local navigation bar at the top of the home screen. This takes them into a
							page to get an overview
							of all the cruises in the same brand they are currently traveling on, along with other
							information such as size of
							the cruise. The user has the option to sort this list with the up and down arrows located
							next to a field. To navigate
							back to map view, the guest can simply tap the "Live Map" button in the local navigation bar
							at the top of the screen.
						</li>

					</ul>
					</br>
					</br>

					<h4>Identifying Problems & Improving</h4>
					<p>Taking my initial sketches to the stakeholders I had access to, which included the mobile
						application team's manager,
						scrum master, digital guest technology lead, and business technology analyst, I received various
						helpful responses
						that I overlooked, and I used it to further put myself in the shoes of a real guest onboard a
						cruise. The primary concerns
						I received includes:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<h6>
								<b>Hidden affordances are unlikely for users to discover:</b>
							</h6>
							Given that Holland America and Seabourn's guests are of older age, it will most likely be
							difficult for them to understand
							that the side itineary panel and the bottom ship statistics panel can be interacted with.
							This would make them confused
							as to why there are numbers on the left, and would make the whole cruise statistics screen
							inaccessible to them.
						</li>
						</br>
						<li>
							<h6>
								<b>Difficulty recognizing identity of cruises:</b>
							</h6>
							When a cruise is selected on the home screen/map view, the screen does not show the name of
							the ship. This is not considered
							in the initial sketches but is one of the most important piece of information needed to
							identify the ship.
						</li>
						</br>
						<li>
							<h6>
								<b>Inconsistencies with existing web design:</b>
							</h6>
							The screen showing the list view of cruises is inconsistent with the list view of cruises on
							the existing website. The initial
							sketches also do not provide enough visuals, which is less appealing to users because users
							can't see what the cruise
							looks like.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Taking these concerns into consideration, I transformed my sketches to digital wireframes and
						incorporated the following
						changes:
					</p>

					<div class="row" style="margin-top: 3%">
						<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-5 hidden-sm">
							<img src="pictures/halwire5.jpg"
								style="width:auto;height:350px;margin-top:2%;display:inline-block;">
						</div>
						<div class="col">

							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>Identity:</b> Name of cruise displayed when user taps on a cruise icon
									(represented with dot here). Bottom chevron
									displayed next to name to make it obvious there is additional information that can
									be discovered upon tapping on
									the icon.
								</li>
								</br>
								<li>
									<b>Revealing Affordances:</b> Left side itinerary panel includes a popped out arrow
									that makes it obvious the panel
									can be interacted with to find more information.

								</li>
							</ul>

						</div>

					</div>
					<div class="row" style="margin-top: 3%">
						<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-5 hidden-sm">

						</div>
						<div class="col">

							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>Identify today's itinerary:</b> The circle representing today is larger than all
									other circles to allow users to
									easily identify the current day and its corresponding itinerary.
								</li>

							</ul>

						</div>

					</div>
					<div class="row" style="margin-top: 3%">

						<div class="col">

								<li>
									<b>Consistent stats with existing Insight:</b>

									view as currently displayed on the Insight
									proudct.

							</ul>

						</div>

					</div>
					<div class="row" style="margin-top: 3%">
						<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-5 hidden-sm">

						<div class="col">

									<b>Consistent list view:</b>

									current website.
								</li>

							</ul>

						</div>

					</div>

					</br>
					</br>

					<h4>Style Guide</h4>
					<p>
						Given that Holland America Line already established a style guide, we used that to help us make
						decisions regarding fonts,
						sizes, colors, shapes, and margins. In doing so, we ensure that our final product is consistent
						with all of Holland
						America's digital product and that it maintains the company's branding. Below are the three main
						font styles and the
						primary and secondary colors used.
					</p>
					<img src="pictures/halfonts.jpg"
						style="width:auto;height:100px;margin-top:2%; margin-right:5%;display:inline-block;">
					<img src="pictures/halcolors.jpg"
						style="width:auto;height:350px;margin-top:2%;display:inline-block;">


					</br>
					</br>
					</br>


					<h4>Final Design</h4>
					<p>The following design was handed off to developers to implement into Holland America Line's
						Navigator mobile application.
						The mockups below are for Holland America Line, but the version for Seabourn's Source app was
						also designed. Seabourn's
						version contains the exact same layout, but uses colors and fonts according to Seabourn's
						existing style guide.

						</li>
						</br>
						<li>
							<b>Select a cruise:</b> Tapping on the arrow next to the name of a cruise on the local
							navigation bar will expand the
							menu, displaying a list of all cruises in the same brand. Selecting a cruise from this menu
							will navigate the user
							to the current location of that cruise on the map.
						</li>
						</br>
						<li>
							<b>Cruise info:</b> Tapping on the information icon next to the name of the cruise will take
							the user to a screen with
							information all about that cruise. Icons used here is consistent with the icons used on the
							existing website.
						</li>
						</br>
						<li>
							<b>More cruise info:</b> User can scroll down to discover more information on itinerary of
							the selected cruise. To prevent
							overwhelming the user, the information in the cards is minimized by default and can be
							expanded when the user wants
							to learn more about a certain destination.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</br>
					</br>


					<h4>What I Learned</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>Importance of Understanding Users:</b> Given that the majority of Holland America Line
							and Seabourn' guests are older,
							it was crucial for me to understand how to design to meet their needs. In the beginning, my
							designs had several hidden
							affordances that would be difficult for users to discover, which would make whole sections
							of information inaccessible
							to users. This digital fleet map could have been designed with newer design trends in mind,
							but ultimately, usability
							is the key to providing a great user experience. So, when it comes to older users,
							minimalistic ideas, hidden affordances,
							and colors that are difficult on the eyes all need to be avoided. Without understanding who
							Holland and Seabourn's
							guests are, I would not have been able to design a product with their needs met.</li>
						</br>
						<li>
							<b>Adapting to Technical Constraints:</b> In the initial stages of design, I practiced
							divergent thinking and had various
							ideas on several features. For instance, I had imagined the map to be as interactive as
							Google Maps and imagined that
							the live routes of all cruises would be readily available. After evaluating the feasibility
							for implementation with
							the team, I recognized that technical constraints exist-- there is very limited bandwidth
							when onboard a cruise to
							provide for all other cruise's routes, especially when routes are subject to change even
							during the trip. To ensure
							that a design is feasible, communication with the developers is essential especially in the
							early stages of design.
							Evidently, it would not have been wise to have designed high fidelity mockups only to
							discover the design cannot be
							implemented. Evaluating for technical feasibility and adapting to such constraints early on
							is an important factor
							in the success of a design to development handoff.
						</li>
					</ol>

					</br>

					<h4>What I'd Do Differently</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>Create User Personas:</b> Having my managers debrief my on the guests onboard Holland and
							Seabourn's cruises, I felt
							as if I understood the users well enough. I assumed I already had all the information I need
							on them-- age group,
							ethnicity, mobile platform, etc. These data are important, but I did not transform them into
							information I could use
							to design effectively. By skipping user personas, I experienced situations where my designs
							may be fit for young adults
							but not older users onboard the cruise. I believe that if I had created user personas and
							kept them in sight at all
							stages of the design process, I could have done a better job of designing to meet the user's
							needs.
						</li>
						</br>
						<li>
							<b>Test With Real Users:</b> If given the opportunity to access guests onboard a cruise, I
							would have loved to test my
							design with them. I believe it would provide various perspectives that my managers and I
							have not considered. As the
							saying goes, <i>You are not your user,</i>
							so I expect there to be features in my design that actual users may find confusing. Without
							testing, these
							areas of concerns would never surface and be improved.
						</li>
