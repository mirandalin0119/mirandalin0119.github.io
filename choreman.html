				<h4>Problem</h4>
				<p>
					In public colleges, about 40% of full time students live on campus, 40% live off campus, and only 20% are living with parents
					(Tellefsen, 2015). This indicates that living with roommates is very common among college students, but sharing a living
					space with others can be difficult. There are many problems to group living, and from our interviews with college students,
					we have found that the the biggest drawback is the conflict between individual’s living habits.
				</p>

				<div id="hideproblem">
					</br>

					<p>
						How can you have a harmonious living environment when everyone has different expectations of each other? One of the most
						common roommate complaints comes from different ideas of cleanliness in group living (Hartwell-Walker, 2016). A roommate
						may be extremely lazy while another may want to clean everyday; it can be difficult to decide who should clean what
						and how often cleaning should take place. Stress resulting from difficulties in living together can have a negative
						impact on students’ grades, physical, and mental health (Driscoll, 2011).

						</br>
						</br>
						Various existing apps on the market help people keep track of chores they need to accomplish, allowing users to create checklists
						and set notifications to do chores routinely. These existing apps are targeted towards individuals, but a lot of college
						students live with others in dorms or apartments where they will need a shared interface to coordinate chores. Without
						a shared interface, communication is unclear and can result in confusion and frustration regarding the delegation of
						chores. Since different ideas about when to do chores is such a prevalent problem in communal living, effective communication
						and planning is extremely essential in working out different habits and personalities in order to maintain a clean
						space and a healthy roommate relationship.

				</br>
				</br>
				</br>
				</br>
				<h4>Solution</h4>

				<p>
					Our solution to this problem is an application that we designed for people to use collaboratively with their roommates. We
					took inspiration from traditional “chore charts”, where planning chores and assigning household members to chores were
					done on paper, and brought it onto a digital platform suitable for the 21st century.
				</p>

				<div id="hidesolution">
					</br>
					<p>
						Choreman ensures that the process of delegating chores is streamlined and automated, while leaving room for people to personalize
						and customize their chore routines. It allows users to create “groups” of people, i.e. a group of their roommates/housemates
						or even family members. Within those groups, users can create a recurring “weekly routine” by selecting a list of common
						chores to be done in the household every week. Groups can also customize a particular week’s chores to include unique
						chores specific for that week, that’s not to be included in the usual weekly routine.

						</br>
						</br>
						Choreman delegates chores to members of the group with its built-in algorithm. For each chore, the algorithm keeps track
						of a list of people willing to perform that chore and rotates through the list in assigning tasks weekly, this is called
						the “Rotation” setting. Besides rotating through a list of people for a chore, our application also allows for one
						person to always be the only one to perform a specific chore, called the “Static” setting. To ensure that everyone
						is assigned a fair number of chores for any given week, the algorithm takes both settings into account and assigns
						each person to only one chore before assigning additional leftover tasks. The chore assignments the application generates
						can be viewed in Choreman’s calendar, where past and future assignments will all be kept.

						</br>
						</br>
						Our application design is very simple, only including the essentials. The color scheme for our design is based off a popular
						Flat UI color, Peter River, which can be found online under the Explore Themes section of Adobe Color CC. Darker shades
						of the Peter River theme was used for text, and the lighter shade was used for the background. We decided blue would
						be the best choice for color because a large portion of students interviewed identified blue as their favorite color
						or the most relaxing and calming color.

				<h4>User Documentation</h4>

				<p>The follwing information describes screen and interactions in our prototype.</p>

				<div id="hideuserdoc">
					</br>
					<p>
						<b>Sign In/Sign Up:</b>
						The Sign In page is first displayed with a box for the user to type in their phone number and their password to sign in.
						If the user does not have an account yet, they click on the signup button below the sign in button to navigate to the
						signup page. The signup process is fast and easy, only requiring the user to type in their phone number, their password
						twice for confirmation, and their desired display name. To ensure that the number provided is accurate, a text is then
						sent to the user with a link to activate their account. After activation, the user is taken to the Groups Page.


						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Inviting people to a group (Groups Page):</b>
						In the Groups Page, a list view of all the groups the user is involved in is shown. An “add group” button at the end of the
						list takes the user to a “New Group” page. Here, the user types in a name for the new group, such as “Roommates”. Then,
						the user invites others by typing in their phone numbers. (Additional information on receiving and accepting invitation
						will be described in the next paragraph.) Clicking the “Add another person” button allows for additional users’ numbers
						to be inputted and invited to the group. The "Create Group” button at the bottom of the page completes the process
						of creating and inviting users to a group, and takes the user back to the “Groups” page where they see the list of
						groups they’re involved in.
						</br>
						</br>
						Invited members will each be sent an SMS text with a link to the group inviting them to join the group. If that user has
						not registered with the application before, they will be directed to sign up. After signing up, they will be added
						to the group. If the user has an account with the application, they simply accept the invitation by clicking the link
						in the text message to join the group. After every invitation has been accepted or declined, users within the group
						will now be able to create a weekly routine.



						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Menu:</b>
						The menu icon is displayed on the upper left hand corner of every page, allowing users quick access to any page. The menu
						icon is the standard three horizontal lines stacked on top of each other, also known as the Hamburger icon. When clicked
						on, the menu shows up as an overlay sidebar. Pages included in the menu are the Groups page, the Calendar Page, the
						Weekly Routine Page, the Current Week Page, and finally, the Settings Page.


						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Calendar View:</b>
						After clicking into a group from the Groups Page, the user is taken to the Calendar page, where the user will see a calendar
						set up by weekly view. Users can see chores assignments in previous and future weeks by clicking on the left or right
						arrow buttons next to the month, taking them to the previous or next month respectively. Within each month, each week
						is displayed with an information icon next to the week.
						</br>
						</br>
						This Calendar page acts as our homepage for groups, unless a new group that was just created has not finished creating a
						weekly routine. In that situation, instead of being taken to this page, the calendar view, the users will automatically
						be directed to the “Create Weekly Routine” page where they left off in creating their weekly routine. Only after a
						group has a weekly routine set does the Calendar page act as the homepage.


						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Viewing Current Week’s Chores and Assignment:</b>
						Upon clicking on the information icon next to a week of the Calendar Page, that week’s chores and assignment of chores shows
						up in list view. Clicking the back button on a specific week’s assignment of chores will take the user back to the
						weekly Calendar page. A quick way to navigate to the current week’s assignment of chores is to click on the “Current
						Week” button in the menu. This takes the user to the current week’s list of chores and the chore assignments.
						</br>
						</br>
						For any week, current or future, if the user needs to create a one time chore specific to that week only, they can click
						into that week, then click “Add unique chore” on the bottom of the page.


						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Adding Unique Chore to a Specific Week:</b>
						The “Add unique chore” page includes a brief description centered at the top of the page, explaining that a unique chore
						is a one time task excluded from the recurring weekly routine. Any user in the group is able to perform this task of
						adding a unique chore for a specific week. Below the description, there is a text box for the user to type in the name
						of the unique chore, and below that, the user is displayed a list of members in the group. The user selects who is
						to be assigned to that chore by selecting the checkbox next to the person’s name. Below that, the user selects whether
						the individual selected for the chore is to be sent a reminder once a day or once a week. The user finishes by clicking
						the Finish button at the bottom right of the page, where they are taken back to the week they were on. Since unique
						chores are completely separate from the recurring weekly routine, they are excluded from the weekly routine’s algorithm
						for delegating weekly chores.


						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Viewing Weekly Routine:</b>
						To view the weekly routine, the user clicks on “weekly routine” in the menu. This page displays the list of chores included
						in the recurring weekly routine. On the right side of chores, there is an information icon. Upon clicking this, a pop
						up message is displayed as an overlay and shows whether that chore is on a rotation or static setting, and who are
						the individual(s) in line to do the chore. To exit this pop up message, the user clicks anywhere besides the message.


						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Create/Edit Weekly Routine:</b>
						To edit the weekly routine, the user clicks the edit button above the list of tasks, aligned to the information icon. On
						clicking this, delete icons (shown as a dash inside a circle) appear on the left side of every chore, allowing the
						user to delete any task off the weekly routine. Below the last delete button is an add icon (shown as a plus sign inside
						a circle), which takes the user to the “Create Weekly Routine” page.
						</br>
						</br>
						Within the “Create Weekly Routine” section, the first screen displayed is a list of common chores the user can check or uncheck
						in a box on the left side of each chore. The user can also input a chore not on the list by clicking “Add custom chore”
						on the bottom of the page to type in a chore name. After selecting the list of chores for the recurring weekly routine,
						the user clicks on the next arrow on the bottom right corner of the page to proceed.
						</br>
						</br>
						The following screens takes the user through settings for every chore selected. As mentioned earlier, there are two different
						ways to delegate each chore, one is the “Rotation” setting, and the other is the “Static”setting. Each individual settings
						screen for each chore lets users specify this setting with the “Rotation” and “Static” checkboxes at the top, which
						is followed by a brief description of the two options below. The user then selects individuals to include for the chore.
						If “Rotation” is selected, the user can select multiple individuals. However, if the user selects “Static”, only one
						person can be selected. Should the user attempt to select more than one person, the previous individual will automatically
						be deselected. Lastly, at the bottom of the page, the user selects whether the individual(s) selected for the chore
						is to be sent a reminder once a day or once a week. If the user selects once a week, a pop up list of days of the week
						with radio buttons next to each day allows the user to select a specific day for notifications. Clicking anywhere else
						in the background of the pop up list exits the list.
						</br>
						</br>
						After choosing the settings for every chore, the user is displayed the “Finish Weekly Routine” page, which summarizes the
						weekly routine. Each chore the user selected is displayed in list format, followed by the delegation type, rotation
						or static, and then the individual(s) selected for that chore below each chore. After reviewing this summary, the user
						can edit settings for each chore by clicking the back button located at the bottom left to go back, or the user can
						click on the Finish button on the bottom right, which finalizes the weekly routine and takes them back to the “Weekly
						Routine” page.


						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Settings Page:</b>
						The Settings page includes Notification and Profile settings for the user. Personal notifications can be set by selecting
						the circle next to the word “On” or “Off”. Below the “On” button, the user can also select exactly what time he/she
						wants to receive the notification. Under the Profile Settings, there is an edit button aligned to the right that allows
						the user to edit their display name, phone number, or password. Otherwise, the user’s current display name, phone number,
						and password (represented by stars) are shown under the edit button. Lastly, at the bottom left of the page is the
						Logout button.

				<h4>Evaluation</h4>
				<p>
					Our application aims to help people set expectations for their roommates because mismatched expectations is one of the biggest
					sources of miscommunication between roommates (Driscoll, 2011). From informally talking to our classmates, this fact
					has held true.
				</p>
				<div id="hideeval">
					<p>
						</br>
						We talked to around 20 students with roommates at the University of Washington; they range from freshman to graduate students,
						and most stated that one of the main stressors in their relationships with roommates is miscommunication about responsibility
						in their living space. In addition to miscommunication, students also commonly expressed that talking about responsibility
						and expectations makes them uncomfortable.


						</br>
						</br>
						When presented with our solution, most students agreed that our application solves their main problem of lack of communication
						or miscommunication. When asked “How would this application affect you and your roommates’ relationships?”, most students
						answered that the app would have a positive impact on their relationships if it could be used to manage and settle
						different living habits. The feature that our fellow students believed is the most useful is the automatic delegation
						of recurring weekly chores. Many students like the fact that the application takes care of communication between roommates
						for them, and they only have to have a conversation about chores and responsibility once when creating the weekly routine.
						Not only does our application take care of delegating chores, but the application’s algorithm delegates chores as evenly
						as possible, thus reducing any excess burden on one roommate. Students we talked to really appreciated the fairness
						in delegation.

						</br>
						</br>
						From our interviews with a variety of students at the university, we were able to confirm that miscommunication between roommates
						is indeed a valid problem among many, and we believe that the feedback received are representative of the larger population
						of college students living with roommates.

				<h4>Limitations</h4>
				<p>
					Our application functions well under the assumption that all roommates believe that our application and its features meet
					their organizational habits, otherwise the value our application provides would be extremely limited.
				</p>

				<div id="hidelimitations">
					<p>
						</br>
						To ease the process of delegating chores, we added the option for chore assignments to be “static” or “rotating” in the weekly
						routine. This poses some potential problems for delegating unique chores for users every week, because in many cases
						if there is a static chore present in a weekly routine, the person chosen for that static chore may not be given any
						chores on a rotation schedule because of the way the application tries to delegate one person to a unique chore every
						week. This limits the range of chores each person is eligible for, but we believe users will understand this drawback
						if they opt to have a static chore.


						</br>
						</br>
						When it comes to weekly chores, the users cannot decide what day their chore week starts. Adhering to the traditional calendar
						view with Sunday as the first day of the week, the user’s chore week will always begin on Sundays.


						</br>
						</br>
						Another limitation of our solution is that our application’s algorithm for the weekly routine only assigns one person to
						a chore; there is no functionality to have people doing the same chore together. We decided that in order to make our
						process simple and easy to use, we had to limit some potential areas for personalization, which led us to decide that
						each chore should only have one person assigned to it.

						</br>
						</br>
						The most important limitation that could ultimately lead to our application being futile is the fact that users of the application
						have to be willing to use the service. Unfortunately, our application does not provide a solution to the broader and
						more general problem of having a lazy roommate and there is not a function to assure that chores are completed. Our
						app does not aim to force people to do chores, but operates as support for a roommates in the form of a reminder to
						help organize the chore routine in households.
