		<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
	In public colleges, about 40% of full time students live on campus, 40% live off campus, and only
	20% are living with parents (Tellefsen, 2015). This indicates that living with roommates is very common
	among college students, but sharing a living space with others can be difficult. There are many problems
	to group living, and from our interviews with college students, we have found that the the biggest drawback
	is the conflict between individual’s living habits.
</p>

	<div id = "hideproblem">
	</br>

	<p>
	How can you have a harmonious living environment when everyone has different expectations of each other?
	One of the most common roommate complaints comes from different ideas of cleanliness in group
	living (Hartwell-Walker, 2016). A roommate may be extremely lazy while another may want to clean everyday;
	it can be difficult to decide who should clean what and how often cleaning should take place.
	Stress resulting from difficulties in living together can have a negative impact on
	students’ grades, physical, and mental health (Driscoll, 2011).

	</br>
</br>
	Various existing apps on the market help people keep track of chores they need to accomplish, allowing
	users to create checklists and set notifications to do chores routinely. These existing apps are
	targeted towards individuals, but a lot of college students live with others in dorms or apartments
	where they will need a shared interface to coordinate chores. Without a shared interface, communication
	is unclear and can result in confusion and frustration regarding the delegation of chores.
	Since different ideas about when to do chores is such a prevalent problem in communal living,
	effective communication and planning is extremely essential in working out different habits and
	personalities in order to maintain a clean space and a healthy roommate relationship.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
	<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>
	Our solution to this problem is an application that we designed for people to use collaboratively
	with their roommates. We took inspiration from traditional “chore charts”, where planning chores
	and assigning household members to chores were done on paper, and brought it onto a digital platform
	suitable for the 21st century.
</p>

	<div id = "hidesolution">
	</br>
	<p>
	Choreman ensures that the process of delegating chores is streamlined
	and automated, while leaving room for people to personalize and customize their chore routines.
	It allows users to create “groups” of people, i.e. a group of their roommates/housemates or even
	family members. Within those groups, users can create a recurring “weekly routine” by selecting a
	list of common chores to be done in the household every week. Groups can also customize a particular
	week’s chores to include unique chores specific for that week, that’s not to be included in the
	usual weekly routine.

	</br>
	</br>
	Choreman delegates chores to members of the group with its built-in algorithm. For each chore,
	the algorithm keeps track of a list of people willing to perform that chore and rotates through
	the list in assigning tasks weekly, this is called the “Rotation” setting. Besides rotating through
	a list of people for a chore, our application also allows for one person to always be the only
	one to perform a specific chore, called the “Static” setting. To ensure that everyone is assigned
	a fair number of chores for any given week, the algorithm takes both settings into account and
	assigns each person to only one chore before assigning additional leftover tasks.
	The chore assignments the application generates can be viewed in Choreman’s calendar,
	where past and future assignments will all be kept.

	</br>
	</br>
	Our application design is very simple, only including the essentials.
	The color scheme for our design is based off a popular Flat UI color, Peter River,
	which can be found online under the Explore Themes section of Adobe Color CC.
	Darker shades of the Peter River theme was used for text, and the lighter shade was used
	for the background. We decided blue would be the best choice for color because a large portion
	of students interviewed identified blue as their favorite color or the most relaxing and calming color.

	<h4>User Documentation</h4>

	<p>The follwing information describes screen and interactions in our prototype.</p>

	<div id = "hideuserdoc">
	</br>
	<p><b>Sign In/Sign Up:</b>
The Sign In page is first displayed with a box for the user to type in their phone number and
their password to sign in. If the user does not have an account yet, they click
on the signup button below the sign in button to navigate to the signup page.
The signup process is fast and easy, only requiring the user to type in their phone number,
their password twice for confirmation, and their desired display name. To ensure that the number
provided is accurate, a text is then sent to the user with a link to activate their account.
After activation, the user is taken to the Groups Page.


	</br>
	</br>
	<b>Inviting people to a group (Groups Page):</b>
In the Groups Page, a list view of all the groups the user is involved in is shown.
An “add group” button at the end of the list takes the user to a “New Group” page.
 Here, the user types in a name for the new group, such as “Roommates”. Then, the user invites
 others by typing in their phone numbers. (Additional information on receiving and accepting
 invitation will be described in the next paragraph.) Clicking the “Add another person” button
 allows for additional users’ numbers to be inputted and invited to the group. The "Create Group”
 button at the bottom of the page completes the process of creating and inviting users to a group,
and takes the user back to the “Groups” page where they see the list of groups they’re involved in.
</br></br>
Invited members will each be sent an SMS text with a link to the group inviting them to join the group.
If that user has not registered with the application before, they will be directed to sign up.
After signing up, they will be added to the group. If the user has an account with the application,
they simply accept the invitation by clicking the link in the text message to join the group.
After every invitation has been accepted or declined, users within the group will now be able to
create a weekly routine.



	</br>
	</br>
	<b>Menu:</b>
The menu icon is displayed on the upper left hand corner of every page, allowing users quick
access to any page. The menu icon is the standard three horizontal lines stacked on top of
each other, also known as the Hamburger icon. When clicked on, the menu shows up as an overlay
sidebar. Pages included in the menu are the Groups page, the Calendar Page,
the Weekly Routine Page, the Current Week Page, and finally, the Settings Page.


	</br>
	</br>
	<b>Calendar View:</b>
After clicking into a group from the Groups Page, the user is taken to the Calendar page, where the user
will see a calendar set up by weekly view. Users can see chores assignments in previous and
future weeks by clicking on the left or right arrow buttons next to the month, taking them to the
previous or next month respectively. Within each month, each week is displayed with an information
icon next to the week.
</br></br>
This Calendar page acts as our homepage for groups, unless a new group that was just created has
not finished creating a weekly routine. In that situation, instead of being taken to this page,
the calendar view, the users will automatically be directed to the “Create Weekly Routine” page
where they left off in creating their weekly routine. Only after a group has a weekly routine
set does the Calendar page act as the homepage.


</br>
</br>
<b>Viewing Current Week’s Chores and Assignment:</b>
Upon clicking on the information icon next to a week of the Calendar Page, that week’s chores
and assignment of chores shows up in list view. Clicking the back button on a
specific week’s assignment of chores will take the user back to the weekly Calendar page.
A quick way to navigate to the current week’s assignment of chores is to click on the
“Current Week” button in the menu. This takes the user to the current week’s list of chores and
the chore assignments.
</br></br>
For any week, current or future, if the user needs to create a one time chore specific to that week only, they can click into that week, then click “Add unique chore” on the bottom of the page.


</br>
</br>
<b>Adding Unique Chore to a Specific Week:</b>
The “Add unique chore” page includes a brief description centered at the top of
the page, explaining that a unique chore is a one time task excluded from the recurring weekly routine.
Any user in the group is able to perform this task of adding a unique chore for a specific week.
Below the description, there is a text box for the user to type in the name of the unique chore,
and below that, the user is displayed a list of members in the group. The user selects who is to
be assigned to that chore by selecting the checkbox next to the person’s name. Below that, the
user selects whether the individual selected for the chore is to be sent a reminder once a day
or once a week. The user finishes by clicking the Finish button at the bottom right of the page,
where they are taken back to the week they were on. Since unique chores are completely separate
from the recurring weekly routine, they are excluded from the weekly routine’s algorithm for
delegating weekly chores.


</br>
</br>
<b>Viewing Weekly Routine:</b>
To view the weekly routine, the user clicks on “weekly routine” in the menu.
This page displays the list of chores included in the recurring weekly routine.
On the right side of chores, there is an information icon. Upon clicking this, a pop up
 message is displayed as an overlay and shows whether that chore is on a
 rotation or static setting, and who are the individual(s) in line to do the chore.
 To exit this pop up message, the user clicks anywhere besides the message.


</br>
</br>
<b>Create/Edit Weekly Routine:</b>
To edit the weekly routine, the user clicks the edit button above the list of tasks,
aligned to the information icon. On clicking this, delete icons (shown as a dash inside a circle)
appear on the left side of every chore, allowing the user to delete any task off the weekly
routine. Below the last delete button is an add icon (shown as a plus sign inside a circle),
which takes the user to the “Create Weekly Routine” page.
</br></br>
Within the “Create Weekly Routine” section, the first screen displayed is a list of common
chores the user can check or uncheck in a box on the left side of each chore. The user can
also input a chore not on the list by clicking “Add custom chore” on the bottom of the page
to type in a chore name. After selecting the list of chores for the recurring weekly routine,
the user clicks on the next arrow on the bottom right corner of the page to proceed.
</br></br>
The following screens takes the user through settings for every chore selected. As mentioned earlier,
there are two different ways to delegate each chore, one is the “Rotation” setting, and the other is
the “Static”setting. Each individual settings screen for each chore lets users specify this setting
with the “Rotation” and “Static” checkboxes at the top, which is followed by a brief
description of the two options below. The user then selects individuals to include for the chore.
If “Rotation” is selected, the user can select multiple individuals. However, if the user
selects “Static”, only one person can be selected. Should the user attempt to select more than one person,
the previous individual will automatically be deselected. Lastly, at the bottom of the page,
the user selects whether the individual(s) selected for the chore is to be sent a reminder
once a day or once a week. If the user selects once a week, a pop up list of days of the
week with radio buttons next to each day allows the user to select a specific day for
notifications. Clicking anywhere else in the background of the pop up list exits the list.
</br></br>
After choosing the settings for every chore, the user is displayed the “Finish Weekly Routine” page,
which summarizes the weekly routine. Each chore the user selected is displayed in
list format, followed by the delegation type, rotation or static, and then the individual(s)
selected for that chore below each chore. After reviewing this summary, the user can edit settings
for each chore by clicking the back button located at the bottom left to go back, or the user can
click on the Finish button on the bottom right, which finalizes the weekly routine and takes them
back to the “Weekly Routine” page.


</br>
</br>
<b>Settings Page:</b>
The Settings page includes Notification and Profile settings for the user.
Personal notifications can be set by selecting the circle next to the word “On” or “Off”.
Below the “On” button, the user can also select exactly what time he/she wants to receive
the notification. Under the Profile Settings, there is an edit button aligned to the right
that allows the user to edit their display name, phone number, or password. Otherwise, the
user’s current display name, phone number, and password (represented by stars) are shown
under the edit button. Lastly, at the bottom left of the page is the Logout button.

	<h4>Evaluation</h4>
<p>
	Our application aims to help people set expectations for their roommates because mismatched
	expectations is one of the biggest sources of miscommunication between roommates (Driscoll, 2011).
	From informally talking to our classmates, this fact has held true.
</p>
	<div id = "hideeval">
<p>
	</br>
	We talked to around 20 students with roommates at the University of Washington;
	they range from freshman to graduate students, and most stated that one of the main
	stressors in their relationships with roommates is miscommunication about responsibility
	in their living space. In addition to miscommunication, students also commonly expressed
	that talking about responsibility and expectations makes them uncomfortable.


	</br>
	</br>
	When presented with our solution, most students agreed that our application solves
	their main problem of lack of communication or miscommunication. When asked
	“How would this application affect you and your roommates’ relationships?”,
	most students answered that the app would have a positive impact on their relationships
	if it could be used to manage and settle different living habits. The feature that our
	fellow students believed is the most useful is the automatic delegation of recurring weekly chores.
	Many students like the fact that the application takes care of communication between roommates
	for them, and they only have to have a conversation about chores and responsibility once
	 when creating the weekly routine. Not only does our application take care of delegating chores,
	 but the application’s algorithm delegates chores as evenly as possible, thus reducing any
	 excess burden on one roommate. Students we talked to really appreciated the fairness in delegation.

	</br>
	</br>
	From our interviews with a variety of students at the university,
	we were able to confirm that miscommunication between roommates is indeed a valid problem among many,
	and we believe that the feedback received are representative of the larger population of
	college students living with roommates.
</p>

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
	<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>
	Our application functions well under the assumption that all roommates believe that our application
	and its features meet their organizational habits, otherwise the value our application provides
	would be extremely limited.
</p>

	<div id = "hidelimitations">
<p>
	</br>
	To ease the process of delegating chores, we added the option for chore assignments to be “static”
	or “rotating” in the weekly routine. This poses some potential problems for delegating unique
	chores for users every week, because in many cases if there is a static chore present in a
	weekly routine, the person chosen for that static chore may not be given any chores on a
	rotation schedule because of the way the application tries to delegate one person to a unique
	chore every week. This limits the range of chores each person is eligible for, but we believe
	users will understand this drawback if they opt to have a static chore.


	</br>
	</br>
	When it comes to weekly chores, the users cannot decide what day their chore week starts.
	Adhering to the traditional calendar view with Sunday as the first day of the week,
	the user’s chore week will always begin on Sundays.


	</br>
	</br>
	Another limitation of our solution is that our application’s algorithm for the weekly
	routine only assigns one person to a chore; there is no functionality to have people doing
	the same chore together. We decided that in order to make our process simple and easy to use,
	we had to limit some potential areas for personalization, which led us to decide that each chore
	should only have one person assigned to it.

	</br>
	</br>
	The most important limitation that could ultimately lead to our application being futile is the
	fact that users of the application have to be willing to use the service.
	Unfortunately, our application does not provide a solution to the broader and more general
	problem of having a lazy roommate and there is not a function to assure that chores are completed.
	Our app does not aim to force people to do chores, but operates as support for a roommates in
	the form of a reminder to help organize the chore routine in households.
