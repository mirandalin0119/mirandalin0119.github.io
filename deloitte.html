                    <h4> Context</h4>
                    <p> As part of the University of Washington's Informatics major, working on a capstone project is a
                        requirement
                        prior to graduation. For this, we have the option to seek out a sponsoring company if
                        interested,
                        and I was able to apply and receive an offer from <u>Deloitte Digital</u>. Working alongside Deloitte,
                        my
                        team of three others and I created an Android mobile application to help tackle common
                        misconceptions
                        and stereotypes regarding homelessness in Seattle. In the process, we conducted extensive user
                        research
                        and pivoted multiple times before settling on tackling this problem statement that we felt would
                        best serve the homeless community at this point:
                    </p>
                    <b>How do we address the common stereotypes surrounding the homeless community in Seattle and help
                        create
                        empathy for this population to encourage more people to donate and volunteer?
                    </b>

                    </br>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    </br>

                    <h4>Identifying the Problem</h4>
                    <p> The original prompt given to us by Deloitte is as follows:</p>
                    <b>Design and develop a mobile application that crowdsources data from various sources to provide
                        helpful
                        information to the homeless public in Seattle.
                    </b>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        We took the prompt and decided to create an app that gathers information from various
                        organizations in Seattle and organize
                        it to provide homeless individuals with food and shelter availability. Ultimately, we wanted to
                        help
                        the homeless population make better informed decisions for which organizations to visit based on
                        their location and needs. However, after meeting with our Capstone advisor, who has extensive
                        experience
                        in strategies for social impact, we believed our vision would not effectively address an
                        information
                        need of the homeless community. Through our own research and resources provided by our advisor,
                        we
                        realized that we were
                        <b>assuming the needs</b> of users and that simply pointing folks to shelters and resources
                        might not
                        be the most helpful for these reasons:
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Homelessness is a complex and systematic issue, each individual case is widely different and
                            difficult
                            to address.</li>
                        <li>Many homeless individuals don’t want to stay at shelters because of privacy, safety,
                            dignity, and
                            other personal concerns.</li>
                        <li>Shelters sometimes have strict rules and sometimes may have a religious agenda, conflicting
                            with
                            someone’s beliefs. </li>
                        <li>There are not enough “spots” in “shelters” to give every person experiencing homelessness a
                            place
                            to sleep.</li>
                        <li>Shelters do not have the capacity to track bed availability.</li>
                    </ol>

                    </br>
                    <p>
                        Taking inspiration from our own lack of understanding regarding the relationship between
                        homeless individuals and shelters,
                        we decided to move in a different direction and considered:</p>

                    <b> How do we help the general public understand the difficulties of navigating homeless shelters
                        from both
                        homeless individuals' perspective, and staffs at shelter's perspective? </b>

                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        Our team then went through hours of research to understand homeless shelters--their difficulties
                        in people, finance, and
                        the political system. Collectively, we agreed on building an app that would simulate what it's
                        like
                        to run a homeless shelter; portraying the lives of homeless individuals and volunteers/staffs
                        managing
                        shelters to illustrate the difficult decisions shelters have to make. After producing a MVP of
                        the
                        Shelter Simulator, we did
                        <b>validation testing</b> to ensure our project is useful in helping the general public gain a
                        better
                        understanding of the homelessness problem in Seattle. Therefore, we reached out to David Hendry,
                        a professor at the UW with substantial research experience regarding homeless youths, to ask for
                        his feedback. The pivotal question he asked during our meeting was
                        <u> Why would I (or an average person in Seattle) want to run a homeless shelter?</u>
                        Starting and managing a homeless shelter is like running a business-- it's tough and not
                        everyone is interested in becoming
                        an entrepreneur. Therefore, our team decided to change the direction of our project again. We
                        looked
                        back at our problem statement and agreed that we ultimately want to help instill empathy in our
                        community
                        for the homeless population and address any stereotypes. Finally, we agreed on our last problem
                        statement
                        mentioned at the very beginning:
                    </p>


                    <b>How do we address the common stereotypes surrounding the homeless community in Seattle and help
                        create
                        empathy for this population to encourage more people to donate and volunteer?
                    </b>
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    </br>

                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p>After clarifiyng the problem we wanted to tackle, we brainstormed and researched more on how to
                        create
                        empathy for our homeless population. In our research, we: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>talked to professors</li>
                        <li>volunteered at organizations serving the homeless</li>
                        <li>interviewed organizations serving the homeless</li>
                        <li>read research papers and stories in the problem space</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With these insights, we moved on to discuss exactly what we are producing and finalized
                        our decision
                        on creating an Android app for a
                        <b>collection of interactive stories, based on the real lives of homeless individuals and
                            volunteers

                    </br>
                    </br>

                    <h4>Features</h4>
                    <p>With a clear direction, we came up with the following features to include in our app:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interactive storytelling to portray the lives of homeless individuals and volunteers in the
                            homelessness
                            context
                        </li>
                        <li>Real perspectives of homeless and volunteers' stories</li>
                        <li>Relevant statistics embedded throughout to educate users on the homelessness problem</li>
                    </ul>
                    </br>

                            as a list of key decisions made by the subject. At the bottom of the page are two CTAs: one
                            being
                            to view the source of the story, and the second being a navigation CTA to take the user to
                            another
                            story.
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>Identifying Problems & Improving</h4>
                    <p>Taking my initial sketches to our stakeholders I received various helpful responses that I
                        overlooked.
                        The primary concerns I received includes:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h6>
                                <b>Lack of Context:</b>
                            </h6>
                            The design does not include any introduction of what the app is about, making the home
                            screen of a list of names confusing.
                            There is also no background on a story; users jump directly into a story without knowing
                            what
                            to expect.
                        </li>
                        </br>
                        <li>
                            <h6>
                                <b>Lack of Interaction:</b>
                            </h6>
                            The story layout is like that of a digital magazine: it includes pictures and text, and a
                            button for each section of the
                            story that highlights a decision made by the subject of the story; however, it is ultimately
                            a navigation control that serves to take the user to the next part of the story. The lack of
                            interactive elements make the user experience dull and uninviting.
                        </li>
                        </br>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Taking these concerns into consideration, I made the following changes:

                    <p>Taking the updated design to our stakeholders, I received the following feedback:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h6>
                                <b>Background of Subjects:</b>
                            </h6>
                            Though a tagline is included for each subject of a story, it still lacks an introduction to
                            who the subject is. This makes
                            the subject feel distant and abstract.
                        </li>
                        </br>
                        <li>

                                <b>Color Choices:</b>
                            </h6>
                            Too much red used; makes the environment feel unwelcoming and dangerous.

                            </h6>
                            Stock photography makes the story abstract and unpersonal. The photo composition doesn't
                            feel "real".
                        </li>

                    </ul>


                    <h4>Design Language</h4>
                    <p>
                        The lack of a style guide for our app made it difficult to move forward from the feedback
                        received regarding color and visuals.
                        Therefore, I paused on designing the UI of the app and focused on developing a style guide for
                        the
                        branding of our product that was to be used throughout (landing page, poster, app).

                    </p>
                    <center>
                        <img src="pictures/delstyle.png"
                            style="width:auto;height:500px;margin-top:1%; display:inline-block;">
                    </center>

                    </br>
                    </br>
                    </br>

                    <h4>High Fidelity Mockups</h4>
                    <p>After creating a style guide, I revisited the feedback received for the second iteration of the
                        app design and made the following changes. Overall, the visual design was changed to align with
                        the
                        typography and color palette defined in the style guide. To address the feedback received, I
                        made the cards
                        on the home screen expandable. Upon tapping on the chevron of a card, it expands into a short
                        biography about the subject of the story. The end of summary screen was also changed; the
                        horizontal scroll view of "Key Decisions" was replaced with a timeline layout. This allows the
                        user to review the key decisions in a more convenient way than having to scroll horizontally. I
                        also replaced the visuals in the app, removing the stock photography and instead, using outlined
                        icons throughout. This presents a more approchable tone to the homelessness context.

                            <b>The value of testing:</b> Through validation testing with individuals and organizations
                            that are professionals in the homeless problem space, our team gained pivotal insights and
                            feedback that aligned our final project in the right direction. Without reaching out for
                            feedback, we would've been stuck on the first idea where we were wrongly <i>assuming the
                                needs</i> of our users.

                            <b>Be open to critique and change:</b> It's difficult when stakeholders shoot down your
                            ideas and/or designs, making it seem as if all your efforts are ignored. However, all
                            stakeholders work together to see the success of the final product. To be open to critique,
                            it's helpful to see these stakeholders as members of your team rather than an authoritative
                            power. By keeping an open mind and not getting attached to an idea, our team was able to
                            design and develop a product significantly better for creating empathy in the homelessness
                            problem space.

                            <b>The importance of defining a brand:</b> In the wireframing stage, the low-fidelity
                            wireframes were done without attention to color and typography. However, it was difficult to
                            transform these into higher fidelity where visual design became a stronger focus. I
                            struggled on choosing the right colors, fonts, and visuals to make the design as inviting as
                            possible. There is just so many options and combinations of visual hierarchy possible that
                            it was difficult to settle on anything. After developing a design language and a
                            corresponding style guide, it made the whole process of designing the app, poster, and
                            landing page of the project easier. Additionally, by defining a brand, it ensured for
                            consistency between the products.
